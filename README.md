# state_game
 
A simple html game that has each page represent a different state in a game.
It is just a simple click a link or mute button to get the 
Each node is just stored in the same folder and gets each link to a part of the game from that one folder.
You should be able to just download the folder of content and open it with any browser that you have. Make sure to click the file state_game.html since that is the beginning web.
I have hyperlinks that take you to a new html that serves as a new state.
I got to relearn some of the functions of HTML since I havenâ€™t practiced with it since High School senior year and also what has changed since then.
I would have liked to try and figure out how to have it autoplay without being muted because browsers no longer support autoplay with sound but you can when it's muted first.
